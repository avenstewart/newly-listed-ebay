# new-ebay-items
A script that constantly checks for new items (provided by a url for now)

### Python needs
- beautifulsoup4
- requests

### Things used (credit & cool things)
- [AppleScript to send messages (only tested with imessage)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11812184/how-to-send-an-imessage-text-with-applescript-only-in-provided-service/19483011#19483011)

### TODO
- http://www.helios825.org/url-parameters.php ADD SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM URL IN INPUT
- option for alert or open
- maybe change to use the ebay api instead!?!?! [here](https://developer.ebay.com/Devzone/finding/CallRef/findItemsAdvanced.html)(but then it would need keys)
